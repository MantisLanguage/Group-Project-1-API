- Additionally, twitch tv will be linked so that the user can view live content about the video game suggest

- Release date would be used to create an alternate functionality as well with a clickable button to "search new released for me" and will bring them to a list of the video games coming out in the next X months 
- We could also filter by gaming platform, PC, Xbox, PS4, top ratings, release date, etc
